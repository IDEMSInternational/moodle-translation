    <intro>&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) is a training program which aims to assist smallholder farmers in making well-informed choices regarding crop, livestock and livelihood in variable climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ghana, a comprehensive training session engaged around 4700 farmers from 124 communities spanning six districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the training's effectiveness and observe the subsequent changes implemented by the participants, a survey was conducted. For this purpose, 416 households were selected at random from 20 communities, encompassing all six districts within the northern region of Ghana. The outcomes of this survey are detailed in the provided dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to delve into qualitative aspects, 18 additional households were purposively sampled for in-depth case study fieldwork.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
