    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;An internal report will document all meaningful information from a study, whether it is publishable or not. It will be a key documentation of interactions, interpretations and impressions which can be referred back to at a later stage to ensure accurate recall. In qualitative research, these recordings will build on and expand your field notes, and digitalising these into a report will enable sharing with the team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
