    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations)’s &lt;a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/The%2010%20elements%20of%20agroecology.pdf"&gt;agroecological principle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Synergies is an important aspect to the concept of multidimensionality as “[b]uilding synergies in food systems delivers multiple benefits. By optimizing biological synergies, agroecological practices enhance ecological functions, leading to greater resource-use efficiency and resilience… At the landscape level, synchronization of productive activities in time and space is necessary to enhance synergies. Soil erosion control using Calliandra hedgerows is common in integrated agroecological systems in the East African Highlands. In this example, the management practice of periodic pruning reduces tree competition with crops grown between hedgerows and at the same time provides feed for animals, creating synergies between the different components. Pastoralism and extensive livestock grazing systems manage complex interactions between people, multi-species herds and variable environmental conditions, building resilience and contributing to ecosystem services such as seed dispersal, habitat preservation and soil fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While agroecological approaches strive to maximise synergies, trade-offs also occur in natural and human systems. For example, the allocation of resource use or access rights often involve trade-offs.”&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
