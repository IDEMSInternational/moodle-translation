    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations) has defined &lt;a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/The%2010%20elements%20of%20agroecology.pdf"&gt;10 agroecological principles&lt;/a&gt;, and the principle of Co-creation and sharing of knowledge highlights why the concept of Options by Context is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Agroecology depends on context-specific knowledge. It does not offer fixed prescriptions – rather, agroecological practices are tailored to fit the environmental, social, economic, cultural and political context. The co-creation and sharing of knowledge plays a central role in the process of developing and implementing agroecological innovations to address challenges across food systems including adaptation to climate change. Through the co-creation process, agroecology blends traditional and indigenous knowledge, producers’ and traders’ practical knowledge, and global scientific knowledge. ”&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
