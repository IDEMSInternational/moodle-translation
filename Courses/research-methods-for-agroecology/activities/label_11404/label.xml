    <intro>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally science is often about finding the best. In an experiment you are testing treatments to find the best treatment, in a survey you are trying to find factors to know what positively influences the outcome, in an opportunistic study, you are trying to understand influential factors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, more and more there is a recognition that there is no blanket “best”. Instead we should be looking for options by context: Finding things that are better for who and for where. Doing this involves accepting diversity, and studying for diversity rather than homogeneity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When analysing data, it is crucial to consider the individual preferences and needs of the users. &lt;strong&gt;There is often rarely a universally applicable or "best" solution that fits all situations.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, farmers may have different requirements based on factors like their desired season length for crops. This concept is known as Options by Context, where the conclusions of the analysis acknowledges the need for tailored solutions based on specific contexts.
