    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people or animals are involved in research, either directly or indirectly, it is vital that we consider how the research might impact them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ethical research involving people should be voluntary and appropriately informed. It should respect their rights and seek to minimise risk or harm. This is particularly important if children or vulnerable adults are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Protecting peopleâ€™s environments is also an important principle of ethical research. Whether research is conducted on stations, on farms or in other spaces, the study must reflect on the potential impacts it could have and consider ways to address this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Potential ethical issues should be considered at all stages of the research process to ensure the research is beneficial and minimises harm.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
