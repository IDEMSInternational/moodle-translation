In most fields, there are few publications which are relevant at both levels and so a study needs to engage separately in literature that is theoretically interesting, and contextually relevant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-646e1efb-7fff-6529-4a85-64bb83ab6436"&gt;Later on in the research process, when you’re sharing your results with others, it’s vital that you reference all literature that you reference in your work: this simultaneously credits others for their work and protects you from any mistakes they may have made!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
