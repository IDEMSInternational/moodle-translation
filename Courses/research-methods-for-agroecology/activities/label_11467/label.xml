    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life is complex and interrelated; our research must reflect this by using a holistic approach and by considering multiple perspectives and dimensions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most problems are multidimensional and an optimal solution for one domain is unlikely to be the optimal solution for another domain. As researchers, we need to be clear about our priorities, the choices we make, and why we made these choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Agroecological research is about being precise about what contexts or domains the option will be suitable for. For example, a crop variety may be produce little grain compared to other varieties, but may be very drought resistant and the fodder may be a rich source of animal feed and compost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
