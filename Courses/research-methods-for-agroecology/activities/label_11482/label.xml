    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The holistic approach required by agroecological research needs new and improved research methods that is locally relevant and appropriate given the diversity and variability of contexts, values and motivations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Traditional agricultural research uses ‘representational’ contexts to find the optimum solution of a single element of a system but we have seen that this is too simple. For example, only considering the increased yields produced by the use of chemical fertilisers ignores their financial and environmental costs. If we think about the changing climate, we see too that we can no longer rely on ‘normal’ seasonal weather patterns, and so our knowledge of crop varieties needs to include details about the resistance of the variety to climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To achieve the level of detail and understanding needed in contemporary agroecological research, we need large numbers (N) of trials and participants. Collaborating with farmers or other key stakeholders in the research is a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, farmer research networks (FRNs) is a research approach where farmers are involved in the heart of the research process. FRNs have the potential to produce high quality findings of benefit not only to the farmers involved in the study, but to other farmers in similar contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
