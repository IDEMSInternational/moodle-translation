You can use any number of tools to look at this data: some tools exist within KoboToolbox, or you can download the data and look at it in a spreadsheet or stats package. Often it is good to use multiple tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-520dd6aa-7fff-e765-d6cb-6d96e4b6bd66"&gt;Sense-check your data to make sure people are understanding the questions, and that the data collected will provide meaningful information that will answer the research question. Carefully designed studies reduces the risk of problems, but even the best designed studies find opportunities to improve through a pilot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-520dd6aa-7fff-e765-d6cb-6d96e4b6bd66"&gt;Do you need to adapt the questionnaire to improve it? Identify possible improvements, and their implications, as soon as you can to update the questionnaires and improve the quality of your data. For example, does the data represent you correctly and adequately? What is missing? Have you included enough open questions, which can provide deeper levels of information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
