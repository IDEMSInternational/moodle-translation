    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create sustainable impact, our research must take into consideration the diversity and changeability of the contexts in which we live and work.&lt;/strong&gt; This means being specific and detailed enough to understand not the best solution for everyone, which doesn’t exist, but potential solutions for particular, defined, social, economic and ecological situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, contexts vary at the global, regional, national and local levels, according to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;physiochemical factors (soil type, climate etc.);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;biological elements (crops, animals etc.);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sociocultural factors (people’s culture, education etc.);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;technologies (farm machinery and techniques);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;economic factors (market proximity, costs etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these characteristics are not static! Within a farm, the household members may for example come and go, or develop new specialisms or interests. External factors also vary: the rains may come late one year, a new market may develop for homemade fertiliser, the region may face important insecurity challenges. Farmers need to have a selection of options from which they can make informed decisions to manage their activities, and this is a huge opportunity for researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
