    <intro>&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet software tends to focus on individual cells, which can result in errors such as when reformatting the data - for example, when rearranging a particular column, or when trying to rearrange data through “copy and paste”. Any level of “copy and paste” is dangerous as it opens the doors to errors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Statistical packages prioritise the analysis of columns, which preserves the associations between variables. This facilitates accurate and reliable analysis, and allows for the easy rearrangement of data.
