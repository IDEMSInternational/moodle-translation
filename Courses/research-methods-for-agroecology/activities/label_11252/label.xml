    <intro>&lt;p&gt;Graphs of basic summaries, such as bar charts, can be achieved using both spreadsheet software and statistics packages. However, leveraging graphics for data visualisation becomes more powerful when using a statistics package.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Graphics from a statistical package are more powerful, partially due to the multidimensional capabilities that are offered in a statistical package. &lt;strong&gt;By adding layers to a graph, analysts can build up this dimensionality - investigating the influence of multiple variables&lt;/strong&gt; in tandem, and independently, &lt;strong&gt;on the outcome.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The concept of layers stems from the grammar of graphics (Wilkinson, 2012). Statistical packages offer a range of powerful visualisations that go beyond basic plots, enabling the analyst to dig deeper into the data and the variability within it. &lt;/p&gt;
