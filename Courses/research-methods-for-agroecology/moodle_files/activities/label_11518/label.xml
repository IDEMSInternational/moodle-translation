    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An internal report will be detailed and complete, and particularly in a qualitative context it should include opportunistic interactions and insights in addition to the formalised study.&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast, any external report is tailored to its audience and should consider the ethical implications of the ideas presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recording observations in field notes is essential in agricultural research: it records any observed phenomenon which might affect the results, for example bird damage or flooding. For impactful research, it is important to go beyond field observation and include the human perspective. For this, taking an anthropological approach to field notes is also required. This involves recording observations of the peopleâ€™s motivations, decisions and actions. For example, understanding why a crop is grown may affect the research objectives or approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is important to document and keep a record of all interesting events and understandings gained from a study. If these are digitalised, they can be shared and built from to inform future research, making the study impactful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There is potential for the detailed information recorded about interactions, impressions and interpretations to have an impact on the wider subjects of a study. Ethical research will consider what potential impacts there may be before sharing details and making research findings public.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
