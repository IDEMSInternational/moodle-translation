    <intro>&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bengaluru, a major Indian city, has experienced a fast urban growth in recent years. This has lead to a substantial demand for dairy products, met in part by urban and peri-urban dairy producers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;"&gt;A study was held which aimed to investigate the urbanisation's effects on dairy production and find key characteristics of dairy systems along Bengaluru's rural-urban boundary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey involved 337 dairy producers and explored aspects such as their household's socio-economic status, dairy herd management, available resources, and involvement in input and output markets. The data provided gives the responses to this survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference:&amp;nbsp;Reichenbach, M., Pinto, A., König, S., Bhatta, R. and Schlecht, E., 2021.
