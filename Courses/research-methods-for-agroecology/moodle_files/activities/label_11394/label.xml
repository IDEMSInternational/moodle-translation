    <intro>&lt;p&gt;There are additional design principles that can be considered, but replication, randomisation, and stratification are the key ones to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor to account for is that respondents may wish to please the surveyor and so respond in a certain way to questions which do not accurately reflect their true opinion or views. In the PICSA example, they aimed to tackle this by having qualitative interviews to cross-reference the paper surveys with. Additionally, a respondent may misremember the information, or may not want to disclose certain details. Some of this response bias can be minimised when planning the survey, such as planning the questionnaire itself to avoid leading questions that may influence certain responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may further be that part of the population is unavailable to be sampled. For example, say you set out to interview a sample of individuals door-to-door in the middle of the day. Some sector of the population may be unavailable if they are working. It is important to question: whose voice is not being heard? As a result, the sample that is surveyed may not reflect the population that is studied. Hence, it is important to be careful when generalising the results. When planning the survey, how the data is collected should be carefully thought through because the design affects the results.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
