    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/The%2010%20elements%20of%20agroecology.pdf"&gt;agroecological principles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;efficiency and recycling&lt;/em&gt;, as defined by the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations), illustrate the need for systems thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Increased resource-use efficiency is an emergent property of agroecological systems that carefully plan and manage diversity to create synergies between different system components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, “[w]aste is a human concept – it does not exist in natural ecosystems. By imitating natural ecosystems, agroecological practices support biological processes that drive the recycling of nutrients, biomass and water within production systems, thereby increasing resource use efficiency and minimizing waste and pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That is, we need to consider efficiency at the systems level rather than the component level: this means that there is no ‘waste’ as such, there are instead opportunities for the re-use of materials in different elements of the system.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
