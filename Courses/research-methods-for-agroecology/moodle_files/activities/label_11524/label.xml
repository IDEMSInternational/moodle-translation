Research methods provide different types of data and so are suitable for different types of research questions: there isn’t a ‘best method’ for all research, there may however be a ‘best method’ or ‘best methods’ for a research question. Indeed many research questions are best answered through combining several research methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
