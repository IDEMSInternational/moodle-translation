    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There isn’t such a thing as an ‘ideal research method’ that can be used in all studies. All methods are suitable for different things. &lt;strong&gt;As a researcher, you should have a toolkit of methods you can use - knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each and which methods are appropriate for which studies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some research questions can’t be answered through quantitative surveys, farm experiments or literature reviews alone. Questions like ‘how’, or ‘why’, especially where people are involved, need to be addressed at a deeper level as they tend to concern what people think, say and do. Qualitative research helps answer these questions, it draws out people’s perspectives and experiences. It focuses on depth, rather than breadth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most studies can benefit from combining research methods. This sometimes means using different methods for each aspect of a study, and sometimes this means using several methods to get a range of insights on one aspect of a study. When several methods are used, the data can then be triangulated, to ensure the quality and accuracy of findings.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
