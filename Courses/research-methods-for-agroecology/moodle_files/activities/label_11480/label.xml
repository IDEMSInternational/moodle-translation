    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/The%2010%20elements%20of%20agroecology.pdf"&gt;agroecological principles&lt;/a&gt; highlight the importance of multi-level systems. The principle of &lt;em&gt;culture and food traditions&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates the interrelatedness of cultural systems and people’s environments, two different types of system: “[c]ultural identity and sense of place are often closely tied to landscapes and food systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The principle of responsible governance demonstrates the interconnectedness of a type of system at different scales: “[a]groecology is best supported by responsible governance mechanisms at different scales. Many countries have already developed national level legislation, policies and programmes that reward agricultural management that enhances biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. Territorial, landscape and community level governance, such as traditional and customary governance models, is also extremely important to foster cooperation between stakeholders, maximising synergies while reducing or managing trade-offs.”&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
