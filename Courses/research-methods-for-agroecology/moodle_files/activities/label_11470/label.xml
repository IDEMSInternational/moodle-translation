    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impactful research takes into account the values and motivations of the potential end users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Standard agricultural research is based on the interests of the researcher, which limits its potential impact as they may be different to the end users. Agroecological research instead takes a bottoms-up approach, combining farmer values and motivations with what research is possible. This helps ensure that the outcomes of a study are relevant, realistic and interesting to the potential users.&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
