    <intro>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Agroecological research requires a holistic approach which takes into account the diversity and variability of contexts, including peopleâ€™s values and motivations, and the multitude of dimensions that coexist at the same time. These concepts, individually and together, exist within systems. &lt;strong&gt;We use systems thinking to understand the relationships between things; systems analysis explores how system components interact and influence each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Traditional research considers an isolated component of a system and aims to optimise this. What is efficient for one component may however be harmful for another component, and so systems thinking requires taking this complexity seriously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Agricultural food systems exist at many levels and are multifunctional, transdisciplinary, dynamic, and influenced by human culture. These systems are worthy of study!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</intro>
